## Notes for Finance

Notes based on some of my gradate program courses since the 2021 ;) 

- Introduce to Finance : This course gave a general introduction about financial market. The note is about the key terms that mentioned during the course. 
- Corporate Valuation and Fundamentals of Finance : Fundamentally introduce how to make evaluations in financial markets. 
- Credit Risk Modeling and Products : Introduce how to identify and measure credit risk. Unfortuantely due to copy right and my limited graphing skills in LaTex I wasn't able to recreat several amazing charts in slides and hope I ll be able to add them once I improve my graphing skills.

Best, 
H.
