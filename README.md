## Notes for Finance

Notes based on some of my gradate program courses since the 2021 ;) 

- [Introduce to Finance](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes_for_Finance/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Finance/FIN5002%20Glossary%20Review%20notes.pdf) : This course gave a general introduction about financial market. The note is about the key terms that mentioned during the course. 
- [Corporate Valuation and Fundamentals of Finance](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes_for_Finance/blob/main/Corporate%20Valuation%20and%20Fundamentals%20of%20Finance/FIN6104%20Corporate%20Valuation%20and%20Fundamentals%20of%20Finance%20Lecture%20Note.pdf) : Fundamentally introduce how to make evaluations in financial markets. 
- [Credit Risk Modeling and Products](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes_for_Finance/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Modeling%20and%20Products/FIN6120%20Credit%20Risk%20Modeling%20and%20Product.pdf) : Introduce how to identify and measure credit risk. Unfortuantely due to copy right and my limited graphing skills in LaTex I wasn't able to recreat several amazing charts in slides and hope I ll be able to add them once I improve my graphing skills.

Best,
